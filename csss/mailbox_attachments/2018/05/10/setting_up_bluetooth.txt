#Bluetooth Speaker connection


to connect to the bluetooth speakers, ive included the below two links that helped me as well as wrote out specifically what i do when trying to connect to bluetooth:

*DO NOT USE THE BLUETOOTH GUI WHEN TRYING TO CONNECT TO THE SPEAKERS, ITS BUGGY AS F**K*
*the speakers will ALWAYS appear as "YU5 by Kanto"

useful links: 
https://wiki.debian.org/BluetoothUser
https://wiki.debian.org/BluetoothUser/a2dp

in regular cases, you will only need to go to "CONNECTING TO THE SPEAKERS" section, some special cases may need the instructions further on

commands: [fyi, the man when running bluetoothctl can be brought up inside bluetoothctl by entering "help"]
$ bluetoothctl

#UNCONNECTING FROM SPEAKERS
*inside the bluetoothctl commandline*
#paired-devices
*if the device "YU5 by Kanto" is listed, remove it using following two commands*:
#disconnect <enter device MAC address>
#remove <enter device MAC address>

#RESTARTING BLUETOOTH SERVICE
then what i basically do is a restart of the bluetooth service, if you get any "errors" you can ignore them
#agent off
#scan off
#power off
wait a couple of seconds then do
#power on
#scan on
#agent on

#CONNECTING TO THE SPEAKERS
the speaker might automatically start appearing after the "scan on" command, after you turn on the agent[ if that is not the case, run the command [# devices]  to display all the devices that have been found], and the just connect to the speakers with the commands
#pair <enter device MAC address>
#connect <enter device MAc address>
*then you can just exit the bluetoothctl with*
#exit

in case you havent noticed, all this is basically doing is "turn it off and turn it back on", i havent yet met a case where this didnt work

then you can just use pavucontrol [Application Menu>Multimedia>PulseAudio Volume Control] to make sure the input of bluetooth [a2dp is properly selected]

#LAST RESORT#
going thru the above 3 sections didnt work, you can also restart the bluetoothctl with systemctl like so:
$ sudo systemctl bluetooth service

if that still doesnt work, then the issue may be that the speakers arent on the right input option, keep clicking the round button until you hear music
