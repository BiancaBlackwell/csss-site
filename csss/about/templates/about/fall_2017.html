        <p class="lead">Bio - Born and raised in North Vancouver, David came to SFU for various reasons, one of which was because some random guy in a TF2 server said something about SFU being good for Computing, and he decided that was good evidence. It ended up being pretty true. David can now be found sitting in the common room too much, generally being loud and occasionally running down the halls. David likes to think he's decently friendly, so feel free to bug him about pretty much anything.</p>
